            <p>Where did you love to play as a child? Maybe it was a tree near your home. A video game where you battled your way through new worlds. Or, like me, a fort you built out of boxes and blankets.
            I’ve been talking about playgrounds a lot lately. I’ve been sliding on a lot of slides and trying out a lot of swings. I’ve listened to peo- ple talk about why they came to play and wondered 
            who wasn’t able to join in. All this may seem odd for an adult who designs technology for a living, but here’s why it matters: Designing for inclusion starts with recognizing exclusion.

            <p>A playground is a perfect microcosm for learning how to start. Think back to the objects and people that occupied your play space. Try to remember what worked well for you. It’s likely there 
            were moments when you were happy to play alone and other moments when you played together with many children. Can you describe what it was that made those spaces inclusive? It’s also likely 
            there were moments when you felt left out, either because there was an object that you couldn’t use, or because you were ostracized by the people around you. What was it that made these spaces 
            exclusionary?
